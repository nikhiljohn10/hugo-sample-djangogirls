You can skip right over this section if you&amp;rsquo;re not using a Chromebook. If you are, your installation experience will be a little different. You can ignore the rest of the installation instructions.
Cloud IDE (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE, AWS Cloud9) # Cloud IDE is a tool that gives you a code editor and access to a computer running on the Internet where you can install, write, and run the software.</description></item><item><title>Command Line</title><link>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/command_line/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/command_line/</guid><description>Introduction to the command-line interface # For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the Your new friend: Command Line video.
It&amp;rsquo;s exciting, right?! You&amp;rsquo;ll write your first line of code in just a few minutes! :)
Let us introduce you to your first new friend: the command line!
The following steps will show you how to use the black window all hackers use. It might look a bit scary at first but really it&amp;rsquo;s just a prompt waiting for commands from you.</description></item><item><title>Python</title><link>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/python/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/python/</guid><description>Python # Let’s start with Python # We&amp;rsquo;re finally here!
But first, let us tell you what Python is. Python is a very popular programming language that can be used for creating websites, games, scientific software, graphics, and much, much more.
Python originated in the late 1980s and its main goal is to be readable by human beings (not only machines!). This is why it looks simpler than other programming languages, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry – Python is also really powerful!</description></item><item><title>Code Editor</title><link>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/code_editor/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/code_editor/</guid><description>Code editor # For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the Installing Python &amp;amp; Code Editor video.
You&amp;rsquo;re about to write your first line of code, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to download a code editor!
Note If you&amp;rsquo;re using a Chromebook, skip this chapter and make sure you follow the Chromebook Setup instructions. The cloud IDE you chose (PaizaCloud Cloud IDE or AWS Cloud9) includes a code editor, and when you open a file in your IDE from the File menu, you will automatically be using the editor.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Environment</title><link>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/virtualenv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/virtualenv/</guid><description>Virtual environment # Getting started # Before we install Django we will get you to install an extremely useful tool to help keep your coding environment tidy on your computer. It&amp;rsquo;s possible to skip this step, but it&amp;rsquo;s highly recommended. Starting with the best possible setup will save you a lot of trouble in the future!
So, let&amp;rsquo;s create a virtual environment (also called a virtualenv). Virtualenv will isolate your Python/Django setup on a per-project basis.</description></item><item><title>Django</title><link>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/django/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/django/</guid><description>Django installation # Note If you&amp;rsquo;re using a Chromebook, skip this chapter and make sure you follow the Chromebook Setup instructions.
Note If you already worked through the Installation steps then you&amp;rsquo;ve already done this – you can go straight to the next chapter!

This software can track changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. A bit like the &amp;ldquo;track changes&amp;rdquo; feature in word processor programs (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer), but much more powerful.
Installing Git # Windows # You can download Git from git-scm.com. You can hit &amp;ldquo;next&amp;rdquo; on all steps except for two: in the step where it asks to choose your editor, you should pick Nano, and in the step entitled &amp;ldquo;Adjusting your PATH environment&amp;rdquo;, choose &amp;ldquo;Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt&amp;rdquo; (the bottom option).</description></item><item><title>PythonAnywhere</title><link>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/pythonanywhere/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugo.nikz.in/installation/pythonanywhere/</guid><description>PythonAnywhere # Basics # PythonAnywhere is a service for running Python code on servers &amp;ldquo;in the cloud&amp;rdquo;.
